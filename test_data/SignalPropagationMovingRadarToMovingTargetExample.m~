%% Signal Propagation from Moving Radar to Moving Target
% Calculate the result of propagating a signal in free space from a radar
% at (1000,0,0) to a target at (300,200,50). Assume the radar moves at 10
% m/s along the _x_-axis, while the target moves at 15 m/s along the
% _y_-axis. The sample rate is 8000 Hz while the operating frequency of the
% radar is 300 MHz. The signal propagation speed takes the default value of
% the speed of light. Transmit five samples of a unit amplitude signal and
% examine the amplitude of the signal at the target.
